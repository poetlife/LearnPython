# The Path to Learn Unittest
> The `unittest` supports **[test automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation), sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and indepenence of the tests for the reporting framework**.
## Basic Concept of Testing
1. __test fixture__
A test fixture represents the _preparation_ needed to perform one or more tests, and any associate cleanup actions.
2. __test case__
A test case is the _individual_ unit of testing. It checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs. `unittest` module provides with a base class: `TestCase` which will be used to create new test cases.
3. __test suite__
